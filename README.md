Ronin
=====

Ronin is a dynamic roaming profile service that allows applications to save user profiles and settings in any format they choose for portability across applications. Ronin delivers content with Node.js and uses Mongodb as a data store.

Ronin supports roaming profile settings in two different ways; global or application. When an application requests a profile, it will always receive the global settings for a profile. Applications can then choose to receive only the settings related to that application, or settings for all applications.
